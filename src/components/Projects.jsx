      details:[
        "Mach25 is a student rocketry competition taking place in Machrihanish, Scotland. I was project manager of the team of 15 people, as well as head of avinoics. We built Macha, a 1.92m tall rocket, carrying our deployable cansat, which mapped safe and unsafe landing zones during descent. Macha reached an apogee of 2,273m.",
        "As head of avinoics, I designed the electronics bay, which housed our COTS flight computers. I was in charge of configuring them for flight, and that telemtrey was correct before flight.",
        "I was addtioanlly on the payload team, where I help design the CanSat housing, made of TPU for impact resistance. I also made a simple gps tracker and ground station by creating custom PCBs and using adafruit sesnors with Raspberry Pi Picos."

        ["This robot was for a college project, as well as Dublin Comic Con.",
        "It was designed in Fusion 360 and Blender, and printed on an Ender 3 v2. It took about 40hrs of sanding, priming and painting to get a smooth finish. ",
        "It used 3 DC motors for the legs & tail, as well as two servos for the arms. This is controlled by a motorboard with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. This is controller over Bluetooth using a second Pico W connted to a analog stick & buttons for control. Additionally, it has a NeoPixel strip for a fire effect, as will as displaying error codes for debugging on the fly."
